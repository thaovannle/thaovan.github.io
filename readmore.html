        Another big and important project in this course. This assignment is to discover and learn new elements/concepts, practising and utilizing prior knowledge of computer science coding languages. But most importantly is to exercise your creative brain to refractor the original code to your own updated version. Most of factors in this project i have already discussed during the <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAFXL5bjiYA/KZaQGtLGB4ne0MJ3v1aFeg/edit?utm_content=DAFXL5bjiYA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton" style="color:green">presentation</a>, so i shall talk about my process. 
        <br><br>
        First is the brainstorming process. I initially sketched a plan of what i could make the game my own version. Despite having so many good ideas, my limited coding skill didnt allow me to accomplish my goals. And this is also my first time ever working with p5.js. Although this game is beginner friendly, but i still find myself not there even at beginner level, so i tried my very best to learn. I watched the tutorial video over and over again to code, write comments and take notes in the code to make sure i know what its function is. 
        <br>
        And onto the creative part, i have a lot of issues of choosing what to do. So i decided to take a p5.js codecademy course so i could look at what i could do using p5.js. It really does work, because codecademy is best at explaining and giving useful practices and challenges. I've been able to learn some basics code, i know it is still not much to make more of a complex game, but im still learning and have room to explore, and it is better to have something then nothing. 
        <br><br>
I have a lot of issues while working on this, but i have figured out ways to solve it after researches, also watching the video again. But github has been so convienience and beneficial for me on this journey. I once attemped to make edits, but it unfortunately did not work out because i deleted something. But git hub saved me because i have already uploaded the code there. So i could return back to the version and continue to work on it. <a href="https://github.com/thaovannle/live-coding-challenge" style="color:green" >(visit github)</a>
Overall, this was a good experience. The biggest barrier of this coding challenge is, everything is new: new tools, new code, new language. But i have overcome this perfectly, and gain lots more materials and skills on the long run. 
        <br><br>
        This one so far is my most favourite piece of code that i have ever code. I cant wait to learn more on p5.js so that i could just make silly games on my free time, what if i got popular, like pacman.
