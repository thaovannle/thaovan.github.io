      welcome to my webpage. Here is my learning evidence of computer science. But I wrote this as if this is a blog or journal. Have fun browsing:)
<br><br><br>
On top you will see a small navigation bar. "the modules" are 10 modules i have accomplished, and and i feel like im pround with the final looks. The sites i have used to practice on is Codecademy, Khan academy. I used Glitch to write my HTML webpage, and p5.js to code in one of my game.
<br><br>
To keep track of the progress i made, Github has been my bestfriend. <a href="https://github.com/thaovannle/thaovan.github.io" style="color:blue">Visit the github here.</a>
<br><br>
To generate my colors, I use <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html" style="color:blue"> this pallete picker </a>  to choose the color i want.
<br><br>
And to help me learn how to write HTMl is the course "Learn HTML" in Codecademy, reference from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" style="color:blue">this website</a> of all HTML syntax, and examples of a webpage that Mr.Osudar posted on google classroom.
