summary has to include:
- how will i continue to learn comp sci/comp programming ( with this )?
- how this one helps/being significant? what makes it dif from other? 
- what did i learn? 
- what do i like?
- any difficulties


Codecademy
Github: Birthday party project https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/projects/birthday-party 

- This module helps me by being a basic kickstart to learning how to use git and git hub to help with 
understanding the concept of version control, switching between master to branches, committing updates.
Working wiht Git Hub maximizes creativity, allows everyone to collaborate anywhere at anytime, thus enhance the accessibility of working in a team .
Not just this project that i chose, the whole course of learning git and github helps me so much in realising there are ways to help my experience of team working much more easier with logical way of organization. 
this helps me with my further education, since im choosing computer science as my future career 
This module helps me practising using git branching, create, delete, merge, switching in betweens. 
It is a simple practice to demonstrate how convenience it is to branch out from your main project and making branches on your own. You also be able to supervise your contents in the most quick and easy way in a few typing. 
- what do i like: how practical this is, and when it is loading, it is quite fun to watch (it is random but it looks like those movies with loading computer screens, and they hack the system within a minute. it is smart)

Anyways, getting back on this blog.

In conclusion, the module gets me  to be familiar with this working style, prepares me for my future career.


Front end: authorization form https://www.codecademy.com/paths/build-web-apps-with-react/tracks/bwa-intro-to-react/modules/react-101-react-components-u/projects/authorization-form 
- The course introduces me to new library, React, an extension for JavaScript. according to codecademy, React is fast, modular and flexible. instead of writing a large file of code, we could divide them to smaller files. also, it is popular, facebook uses it, as well as many other website developers. 
- The module is like a summary of what i have learned through this "intro to JSX" course. i learned how to write JSX elements, and put them together, render them, meaning outputting them on screen. to me this is a fun and fascinating new lesson, i got to extend my knowledge of JavaScript. when working on this course, Introduction to JSX was so far my favourite. It is somehow clicked with how my brain works. Overall, working with Front-End app was a fun but challenging journey, because i was introduced to JS, which i did not know before. It makes me to get interested to Object Oriented Programming. 


Back end: SQL (lyft trip data): https://www.codecademy.com/paths/create-a-back-end-app-with-javascript/tracks/intro-sql-back-end-development/modules/webdev-sql-multiple-tables/projects/multiple-tables-project 
- constrating with Front end, which users can see the physical appearance of the app and being able to interfacing with it, the Back end is important as well, as it is data collecting tools. i pick this project from the SQL section because it is my favourite lesson in the Back end App course. SQL stands for Structurerd Query Language, it is for managing and storing data. from this module and the SQL lesson in general, i learned varities of commands, which are used for creating, editing and altering date tables. tables are my best choice of date collecting and recording form, so this is like, working with excels but by using commands. it helps me in practising this skill of being exact and correctly selecting datas, which is beneficial for my future career that requires me to minimize silly mistakes.

(about natural stimulation course in general)
- the course has been challenging but i have learned alot from it. it shows randomness could be used in a lot of things, in particularly this course we mainly use randomness to draw. in nature, things are random, hence the name, but everything has a limit to it. Like how some types of plants only grow in this specific soil/land, like how our hair knows where to stop growing and not overgrown to our ears. So we learn about gaussian random, map, to create a pattern for randomness. 

- for this project, i used gaussian random to splash the paint, so most of the paint is at the middle of canvas. to make this prettier, i make random color to the paint,so each time a paint dot is placed it is a different color, making the canvas very colorful. throught this module, i have a chance to practice coding using Gaussian random.
